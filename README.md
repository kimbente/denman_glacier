# Mass conservation on rails - Rethinking physics-informed learning of ice flow vector fields

![Description of the image](data.png)

Other title ideas:
- Mass in, mass out:
- underPINNed:

ToDo:
- compute_divergence() function for auxiliary inputs
- incorporate surface slope/gradients as additional predictors, since surface elevation along provides litle lift. 
- run directional conditioning/guidance 
    - partial observations on full grid (not preprocessed yet)
    - partial observations from train and ALSO test data
